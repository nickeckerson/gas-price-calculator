This is a simple Python console program that calculates how much it will cost to fill your car's gas tank.

The user enters:

- Total tank size (in gallons)
- Current gallons in the tank
- Price of gas per gallon

The program then calculates how many gallons are needed to fill the tank and the total cost, and prints the result formatted to two decimal places.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `gas_price.py` file.
3. In a terminal, run:

```bash
python gas_price.py
